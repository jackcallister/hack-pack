# What is Hack Pack?

You can think of Hack Pack like a social club for hackers. Rather than us focus on presentations and speakers (there are already lots of great meet ups which do this) we're focusing on fulfilling the social needs of the community and while we're at it let's educate and share knowledge. 

Join us for:

- Waxing lyrical about node/ruby/next big thing.
- Playing video games
- Trying your hand at table tennis
- Perhaps partaking in a slice of pizza
- Starting side-projects
- Hackathons & workshops
- Making friends!
